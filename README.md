This project was taught as a Technical Project Workshop for the Association of Computer Scientists at the University of Texas at Austin. This project is complete, though small changes may be added in the future. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/UT-ABCS/tech-workshops).  <br />

This workshop will cover the concept of dependency management in Python. The goal of this workshop is to cover how to use third party libraries within Python projects created by the attendees, and how to properly handle them moving forward using the pip tool. You can find the slides associated with this workshop at [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d0vKBPu9wqbpnud9U3NfsE3xE-TyDaMnHuwt9THPxx8/edit?usp=sharing).  <br />
